This was my second challenge from "dailyUI".

The challenge consists in:

"Design a credit card checkout form or page. Don't forget the important elements such as the numbers, dates, security numbers, etc. "

Then. . . .

When I code this challenge, I learnt so much about position, display and z-index. These things certanly will help me on future challenges.

that's all for now.

Contact me for any suggestions or help me to improve my DEV skills I will love it <3
